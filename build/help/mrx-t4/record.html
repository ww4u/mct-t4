<h2>Record Table</h2>
<ul>

<li><h3>PA: absolute coordinates (where x/y/z is the robot's destination coordinate point), PRN/PRA: relative coordinates (based on the current position coordinates, The value of x/y/z is the difference between the coordinates of the current position and the destination coordinates), in addition, x/y/z can be negative</h3>
</li>
<li><h3>If the Line setted checked, the robot uses the straight line from the starting point to the target point as the motion trajectory</h3>
</li>
<li><h3>Each record can add multiple sub-items by right-clicking and each record realize multiple continuous motions, thus the robot realize the complex motion</h3>
</li>
<li><h3>Wrist and Terminal only support PA</h3>
