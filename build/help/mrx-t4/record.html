<ul>
<li><h4>Set up and display the motion table</h4>
<p>* Set and display the configuration of the motion table</p>
<p>* There are three types of motion: PA, PRN, PRA; PA: absolute coordinates (where x/y/z is the robot's destination coordinate point), PRN/PRA: relative coordinates (based on the current position coordinates, The value of x/y/z is the difference between the coordinates of the current position and the destination coordinates), in addition, x/y/z can be negative</p>
<p>* If the Line setted checked, the robot uses the straight line from the starting point to the target point as the motion trajectory</p>
<p>* Each record can add multiple sub-items by right-clicking and each record realize multiple continuous motions, thus the robot realize the complex motion</p>
